Eniac is an e-commerce tech company! As a Data Analyst, I worked on internal data, which, while not anonymized, is a bit more chaotic. This project required advanced data analysis techniques using Python instead of SQL due to the complexity of the tasks.

### Project Overview: 
The goal of this project was to analyze internal company data to address a significant question: Is it beneficial for Eniac to discount its products?

### Stakeholder Perspectives
#### Marketing Team Lead's View:
-Believes that discounts enhance customer acquisition, satisfaction, and retention.
-Argues that discounts contribute to long-term company growth.

#### Main Investors' Concerns:
- Worry that aggressive discounts might harm overall revenue.
- Noted that recent quarterly results showed an increase in order volume but a decrease in total revenue.
- Prefer positioning the company in the quality segment rather than competing on price.


This analysis aimes to provide data-driven insights to resolve the debate on discounting strategies. The findings will help Eniac make informed decisions regarding pricing strategies and future marketing efforts.
