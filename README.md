Eniac is an e-commerce tech company! As a Data Analyst, I worked on internal data, which, while not anonymized, is a bit more chaotic. This project required advanced data analysis techniques using Python instead of SQL due to the complexity of the tasks.

### Project Overview: 
The goal of this project was to analyze internal company data to address a significant question: Is it beneficial for Eniac to discount its products?

#### Marketing Team Lead's View:
- Believes that discounts enhance customer acquisition, satisfaction, and retention.
- Argues that discounts contribute to long-term company growth.

#### Main Investors' Concerns:
- Worry that aggressive discounts might harm overall revenue.
- Noted that recent quarterly results showed an increase in order volume but a decrease in total revenue.
- Prefer positioning the company in the quality segment rather than competing on price.

#### Business Questions:
My analytical and business skills are needed to provide clarity in the following aspects:
- How should products be classified into different categories to simplify reports and analysis?
- What is the distribution of product prices across different categories?
- How many products are being discounted?
- How big are the offered discounts as a percentage of the product prices?
- How do seasonality and special dates (Christmas, Black Friday) affect sales?
- How could data collection be improved?
At the end of this project I am expected to give a presentation to the company board and present the results of my analysis. The presentation needs to be concise, but also engaging and convincing.

This analysis aimes to provide data-driven insights to resolve the debate on discounting strategies and help Eniac make informed decisions regarding pricing strategies and future marketing efforts.
